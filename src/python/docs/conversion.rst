Conversion
**************************


Converter
=========================
The converter is the main capability of xdm.  Currently, we only convert to Xyce.  This makes sense if we are
eventually going to be the internal data model for Xyce.

xdm.py
=========================
xdm.py is the root conversion file for netlist translation.  It is a command-line based interface that provides
options for querying by device type, input language, etc.
