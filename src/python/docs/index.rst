Welcome to xdm's documentation!
===============================

xdm is a name that unfortunately conflicts with the name for the xwindow display manager, which is the default display manager in Linux.   Xyce Data Model shares the xdm moniker.  We claim to be an abstract data model that derives an in-memory circuit representation from a text-based netlist from multiple netlist languages.
